📤 Automated Message Sending: Sends messages to WhatsApp contacts automatically by processing structured .xml files.

🔐 Secure with Personal Token: Uses a hash.dat file for secure and unique identification—no password sharing.

🔄 Persistent Session: Once linked, the app can be reused without rescanning the QR code every time, even after a system reboot.
